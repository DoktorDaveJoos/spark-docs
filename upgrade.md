## Upgrading To Spark 8.0

Spark 8.0 is a simple maintenance release to provide compatibility with Laravel 5.8 and Cashier 9.0. As such, there are no Spark specific upgrade instructions. You should simply upgrade your application using the [Laravel 5.8 upgrade guide](https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/upgrade), and make sure your application pulls Laravel Cashier version 9.0.
